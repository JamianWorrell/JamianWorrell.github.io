# My Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio! I'm passionate about securing digital environments and preventing cyber threats.

## Projects

### Project 1: Analyze Network Traffic with TCPDump

I used tcpdump to capture and analyze TCP traffic. Extracted the packets to a dump file using a custom shell script and then uploaded the file into Wireshark. 

### Project 2: Penetration Testing


I conducted penetration testing for a financial institution, identifying vulnerabilities and providing recommendations for improving their security posture.
